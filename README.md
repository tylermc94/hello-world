Hello World

This repo is where Im going to store anything related to my python learning journey

## todo.py
This is a simple to-do list app that I am slowly adding features to with the help of Claude AI as I learn how to use Python. It creates a task list in the form of a dictionary and is able to manipulate it as well as save and load the list in a JSON file, **todolist.json**
