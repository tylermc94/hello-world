Hello World

This repo is where Im going to store anything related to my python learning journey

## todo.py
This is a simple to-do list app that I am slowly adding features to with the help of Claude AI as I learn how to use Python. It creates a task list in the form of a dictionary and is able to manipulate it as well as save and load the list in a JSON file, **todolist.json**

## Dimmer Switch.py
A basic dimmer program to run on the Raspberry Pi Pico, mostly vibe coded. It just takes input from a pot and dims an LED.

## thermostat.py
This was my thought for a good beginner project before I moved to the to-do list. I think I'll still come back to this, it feels like a good way to integrate my Python skills with my microcontroller skills by making a simple thermostat/heat controller with a Pi Pico.
